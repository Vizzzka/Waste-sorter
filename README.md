Waste-sorter on CNN

In this project, I'll train a convolutional neural network to classify an image as either cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic,
or trash with the fastai library (built on PyTorch). I used an image dataset collected manually by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang.
Download their dataset here to follow along, then move it to the same directory as this notebook.
